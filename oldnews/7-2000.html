I need to get away from all of this for awhile.  Never before has a programming project frustrated me to the point where it wasn't enjoyable anymore.  I am leaving until I find enjoyment in the project again.  This will probably be when Phrodide comes back.

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">I've got good news and bad news for everyone...I'm moving! I'm finally getting out of the small, dead-end job town and moving to the nearest metropolis. My new living quarters (an apartment) is to be ready August 1st, and my room mate will be down here August 8th or 9th. As I'm already feeling the effects, the month of August is going to be the most abnormal and most demanding of my time and money, since I have no furniture, nothing...My dialup will be lost, so I will not have instant internet access. I'm hoping either DSL or Cable will be available there, since these options were never thought of in this town.<BR>
<BR>
What does it mean to you, the public? I'm going to take a little vacation from the Apollo Project, and only a vacation. It will start about August 1st, although it seems like it would be helpful to start it now. I will return when I get DSL/Cable into my new home. I expect this to be done about the last week of August.<BR>
<BR>
Before I go, I hope to fix the wonderful bug that prevents us from having RDP demos and games from working (slowly, but working). This way Azimer can use the time for the plugin, and all is not lost.<BR>
<BR>
See everyone in September!

Once I get decent wireframes working I plan on making a prerelease of the plugin. Thanks to Dtastones for helping me with the screenshot.<P>UPDATE: I tried my plugin in an emulator other then Apollo and it showed 3D just fine in wireframes.  This leads me to believe it's within Apollo itself.  Phrodide and I will try to resolve this issue this week.

I don't feel the information stored in that file is important enough to show on the main page but might be interesting to people who would like to keep track of daily events during our development process.  I was a huge fan of Project Unreality and I would like to do as he did and log all interesting events encountered through the day/week without cluttering the mainpage.

Version C, planned for on about the first week of July, has been steadily growing with more and more features that we didn't plan on including. So Version C may be delayed a little longer, or may be out today. It all mostly depends on where we decide to stop.<BR>
<BR>
Our one little post about Apollo being translated into French has prompted others to join in. So far we have English, French, Spanish, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, and Portuguese. German is lined up to be included on release too.
