I removed the link to the demo plugin down below (no longer needed).  Here is a new plugin to fix some errors
people were having when TR64 would close a rom.  I hope this is the last bug fix I have to make to this audio driver
so I can continue work on the new one.  Snag it <a href=http://apollo.emulation64.com/AudioHLEv12b.zip>here</a>.

It's been ages since I last updated.  I've been very busy with school, life, Audio, and everything.  Trying
to find a good solution for those with HLE Audio problems (though I feel they mistake poor audio plugin
with poor emulation speed on the emulator's behalf).  I've also been trying to get an UltraHLE-like/Daedalus-like
debugger going so Dominator from the company can feel a little more comfortable working with me to fix my
core.  Umm...  I dunno what else to say.  I decided to release a follow up to the HLE Plugin.  This is
pretty much just a maintainance release.  I removed some message windows bjz was seeing when he used it in
TR64.  And since I already allowed Daedalus to use the plugin I might as well make it official.  Once again
this plugin is not the full thing... but it's still good.  -->here<---

I have recieved a good amount of emails with suggestions for names.  Your e-mails haven't gone unread!  I read each and every one of them.

Not of much suprise to me, the emulation websites were quick to point fingers at the general emulation crowd as lamers who caused me to "quit".  That's far from the truth.  People who I don't know never cause me to feel badly about things.  I deal with lame e-mails on a daily basis.  Not a big deal...  I can take it.  The lack of respect was from people close to me, internally in the N64emudev group...  which turns out to be a huge misunderstanding as I stated in a previous news post.  Now... I've gotten overwhelming amounts of support from people who thought the disrespect, lameness was a result of general emulation.  And to be honest, I never knew so many people would feel so strongly about my decision to stop working on Apollo for awhile.  So in doing so, I've decided to do what 1964 had done months ago, and open my source for the general emulation crowd.  I am hoping this decision will make people interested in the project, and perhaps continue Apollo with, or without me as a coder.  I will work on it again someday... just not right now.  My social life is a little more important right now.  Especially since my best friend just lost his gf of 4 years and going throught he same things I did last November.  So the release you will get will be what I haven't had time to work on since January 3rd or so.  Since then, I've been working hard on RSP Audio for TR64 and I will continue to do so.  I will post the analogy I made to Cruiser of Dream64 in an ICQ message:<P>
Coding to me...  is like reading a good book.  You can go all psycho and read a lot of stuff in one day...  but then you get tired and don't feel like reading for awhile... and sometimes you just get too busy to read.  But eventually, you'll want to pick that book back up and start reading again.</P><P>

It's been over two weeks now without with an update.  I haven't gotten any serious inquiries about the position with Apollo.  I am tired of coding Apollo...

Sorry for the lack of updates... and the news section being down.  I've been busy working with F|RES on TR64.  I have FlashRAM support in Apollo now...  It's not working 100% yet but over time I am sure it will.  Not much progress has been made since you last saw it on the messageboard.  I've spent the last 3-5 days on TR64 like I've mentioned.  I also added a popup banner.  Sorry but bandwidth isn't cheap.  It's costing my host $150/month to keep Emulation64 and all hosted sites running.  I can see how someone wouldn't want to pay that out of their own pocket. :)  Better then geocities right? :)  Lastly, I am looking for a possible second coder for the project to start after the next release.  Qualified applicants should have had prior emulation experience (though not a necessity), MIPS knowledge, and a will to work hard on the project.  3D Graphics programmers are welcome too.  If you are interested, please email me at <a href=mailto:azimer@emulation64.com>azimer@emulation64.com</a> and I will setup a time for us to chat.  Please bring a couple samples of your prior work if you believe they are applicable to the position you want with the project.

Just a minor status update on my plans.  Christmas is over now for most of us.  I got a Microsoft Trackball Explorer 1.0 (this will make Counter-Strike more challenging :P), a BJ Cannon Color printer (didn't hook it up or mess with it yet), a VCR, and some clothes.  I think my parents spent ~$200 on me.  I only spent $50 on them. :(  *sigh*... I guess I have an excuse being a poor college student. :D  Anyway... I decided what to do about Apollo.  There are many bugs I found in Apollo v0.01d R6-RC1 which went out to Emulation64 staff and friends.  I think a rewrite is due.  For starters, I HATE the plugin selection dialog box, the multilingual support, and all the "dynarec" options in the GUI that Phrodide put in there.  Also, the timing of the CPU is horrid, the interrupt handling leaves something to be desired, and I would rather rework a few things in the CPU, especially the opcode fetch/translation loop.  The method I have done now is VERY fast, but it could be faster by removing unneeded code from the loop and removing stack operations (thus using naked functions).  This will also come in handy when I do my psuedo dynarec engine which will make code to call each function individually (rather then recompilation).  That is more like a caching interpretive and it removes all need to fetch/translate, but it doesn't remove function calling or allow for need-based optimizations.  Probably more technical talk then most of you care to hear, but it's the next step to producing a dynarec without leaving the interpretive stages completely yet.  All status updates from here on out will be in the developer's log save for a few points of interest I will place right on the main page.  <BR>Merry Christmas, and God bless.

Many people have wondered, and actually thought Apollo was just another dead N64 emulator.  Oh... how wrong could they be?  For starters, I didn't join TR64 so I could leave Apollo behind.  I joined so I could offer them an additional coder on their team.  My work on TR64 in no way interferes with Apollo and vice versa.  Now... I decided to give some of you christmas present.  It's not much, but it will have to do until I finally understand if this one guy wants to co-author or not.  He's very talented and very interested, but it's not set in stone.  He's also busy finishing up his own work so it might be awhile if he does come aboard.  Without furthur delay I decided to speed up Apollo a little bit more and post a couple screen shots of Zelda64 working on the emulator.  The plugins are from <a href=http://www.emuhq.com/truereality/windows/><B>TR64</B></a>.

The time has come to come out of the closet...  No... I am not gay.  Worse.  I am a NES Emu coder. lol.  Just kidding but it caught your attention.  I am doing a NES emu with a few guys and you can check it out <B>here</B>.  It'll be fun.  I will be doing the sound on the system.  Hopefully trying to get it perfect.  Speaking of sound...  Did you HEAR WIP4 of TR64?  WONDERFUL...  hahaha... (as Mario says it).  I guess I can quit beating around the bush.  The status of Apollo is as follows.  Phrodide has left the project for good.  He has left the emulation scene and he has left me in sole custody of the project.  He is also going to give me his v64jr <B>if</B> I attend his wedding *laughs*.  Like I wouldn't try to make it in the first place pfft. :)  You might be "sadden" by this, but I have left Apollo long ago.  Over a week now.  I am on TR64's team now... I won't say much about what I am doing but it's been great so far.  Lets see... Oh yes... Apollo :)  Apollo lives on!  I will keep working on it.  Of course my two new projects take priority.  Now for a little recap of a post a tried to make so many times and to bring closure and perhaps a "tribute" to Phrodide contribution to my coding experiences....  I met Phrodide long ago when I was working in the moonlitcoalition on snesrise.  64bit was the "leader" but he was nothing more then a webmaster.  Phrodide was there once in awhile but he was pretty much quitting sunset by the time I joined in August.  I just finished my NES emulator (unreleased) and I wanted to take on new challenges.  I worked for a long time and then I was approached by 64bits asking me if I think they should fire Phrodide from the project.  I didn't care since I didn't know Phrodide that well... but that night or soon after I really got to meet him for the first time.  We sat in a channel and decided to construct a new N64 emulator which would rival that of UltraHLE.  We didn't get far.  We coded until February when our team of 4 dwindled down to a team of 2.  Phrodide and I disposed of the faulty emulator and constructed Apollo from its ashes.  Today, it's better then that old emulator will ever be.  It's all my work... it's all Phrodide's work.  And now here I am... I learned SO MUCH from Phrodide, and I am truly grateful he gave me a chance one year ago to be part of that N64 emulation dev. team.  Without his guidance, I would have not known how to do anything more then creating a CFB only N64 emulator.  Phrodide is a good friend to me.  I will miss his online presence and my phone bill will be outrageous.  thanks for all the good times man :)  btw, schibo... they would have know sooner or later anyhow... I have an illness I can use as an excuse for murdering lamers :)</P><P>Update: I removed the link to the NES emulator project.  I didn't realize how much unwanted attention the project was getting.  Please disregard the link since it will be relocated soon. Sorry. </P>

Hello, it's me again.  As you can tell, the heading of this post is <I>Broken Promises</I> and that is very suiting.  An Apollo release won't be made this week.  It is now up to Phrodide.  I have done all I am going to do, but I don't have a graphics plugin to distribute with the executable.  So in essence, I am not going to work anymore until then... unless something else comes up.  Lately, I've been spending my time on dinky lil projects that don't require much brain power for me, like AziNES.  You won't be able to download it since I agree there are too many NES emulators and mine is just for me. :)  Anyway... I am sure you will hear from me again before the week's out!!!

I have started work on the Dynamic Recompiler (my own not Phrodide's).  It's going well, but since speaking with a few people, I've decided to hold off until I posssess a compatible interpreter.  This is good for me, but bad for anyone expecting to play games at full speed without a 1.3 or 1.4Ghz Pentium 4.  I know I don't have one. :)  So instead I worked on the interpreter and gave it enough speed to where you can check out the compatibility.  I saw about a 20%-25% speed increase just from some simple handmade assembler code and some rearrangements of when/where things occur.

You can expect a lot more to happen now.  Definately a release before Thanksgiving is possible.  I will start by hunting down the infamous CPU bug and/or making a new CPU completely.  Best of luck to Phrodide in his new task.  Thanks to everyone for their supportive comments.
