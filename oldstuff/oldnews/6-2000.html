<BR>
We've arranged the emulator in such a fashion so that we can work on seperate parts without worrying about stepping on each others toes, and to ease releases. (We put in DLL support.) While there are no DLLs made yet for the emulator, we will work on that soon.<BR>

Three days from now Apollo will be celebrating its one month birthday!!!  Yes yes!  And there's no better way to celebrate the day before summer except with a new release.  This release will contain a few new things and since the last Apollo... it's been completely rewritten.  Come here no later then one minute before the official start of summer for Apollo's new version :D  BTW... thanks to Martin for the excellent Newsupdater... it helps!!! :)

Nothing out of the ordinary for this.<LI>We've just had the memory module rewritten, and greatly simplified. A read from N64 memory takes 5 instructions and requires no look up table. Because of the memory simplification, we disabled controllers for now. <LI>Our general priorities:<LI><UL><LI>Exception Processing (Including TLB exceptions) <LI>Dynarec <LI>Support for 24 and 32 bit color modes <LI>Audio (Interrupt faking at least) <LI>RSP/RDP&nbsp;</LI></UL>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">A few bugs have been found that really should be avoided if possible: </P><li>Running a second rom image will not necessarily work and may slow down your machine. After using the image, close out the emulator completely and restart. The reason is not known yet. <li>There is no extension support for *.rom images. You must find them manually, this will be updated in the next release.<li>Do not attempt to pause the emulator. You will not be able to unpause it :) <li>Lastly, make sure you are in 16bit or 15bit color mode. If not, you will not be able to use the emulator. <P>Thanks to Emul8or, LP-S, and Zersion for the tips.</P>

The Apollo website will from now on be updated with a news script, which makes it easier for Phrodide and Azimer to post.<BR>
