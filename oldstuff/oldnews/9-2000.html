      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">This post comes at 4am in the morning!  I am staying up all night to finish my Spanish composition paper.  Phrodide and I finally spoke about the future of Apollo.  He no longer can be an active part of the project.  He's been working 60-65 hour <B>work</B> weeks on 3 seperate jobs as well as 17 hours of <B>school</B>.  That makes 77-83 hours weeks. 7 x 24 = 168 hours.  168 - 83 = 85.  85/7 = ~12 hours.  So assuming he losing time eating, sleeping, driving to and from, and all other human functions... he basically has no life and no time to program Apollo.  Well... that sucks to be blunt and honest.  But I will try my best to take over his CPU while he's unable to be here.  Most definately not later today since I am pulling an all nighter doing homework and solving the world hunger issues.  I am tired and starting to see things.  I will leave before the post becomes a story of my life.  :) <-- Happy Apollo Face

Nothing got done and Phrodide is still missing.  Someone go find him please. :(  Anyway... As soon as I catch up in my academics I guess I will have to see about solving that CPU bug.  Sorry for the lack of updates.  I hope to be working again soon.  Going to go now and do some homework.

If you have any question feel free to use our message board.  A release can be expected before too long... but don't "hold your breath."  Definately this would happen before Thanksgiving at latest.
