    Uploaded v0.50.1 of the LLE Audio Private Beta.  This one is a bit better then the last.
    It gives me about 58-61 FPS constantly in most games (NTSC) except for a few which it has
    a very odd problem with (that I need to resolve).  Best of luck with it... it's only a WIP.

    <FONT color="#ff5555">)</FONT> LLE Audio Private Beta v0.50.1</FONT></B><BR>
    Decided to release my work I did tonight as a WIP.  This does not use HLE Audio.  It just
    an audio driver like Jabo's DirectSound, or the driver from 1964.  Play with it as much as
    you care...  post problems on the messageboard.  I give this release a 2/5 for stability.
    So be very careful and backup your work.  My computer already shutdown by itself while in
    the middle of Mario64 with it.  lol.  It is basically a rewrite of my previous Audio Drivers
    in a way I can get remixing included...  I also need to talk to schibo about audio accuracy.
    Enjoy...
